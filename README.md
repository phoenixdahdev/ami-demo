# Your BNA UI app 🚀

An [Expo](https://expo.dev) app scaffolded with [BNA UI](https://ui.ahmedbna.com) —
Expo Router, light/dark theming, and a set of components already wired up.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install       # or pnpm / yarn / bun
npx expo start
```

Then press `i` for iOS, `a` for Android, or `w` for web.

Expo needs a flat `node_modules` — Metro and autolinking both read it off disk.
Two of the config files here exist only to guarantee one: `.npmrc` plus
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` keep pnpm off its isolated layout, and `.yarnrc.yml` keeps
yarn 2+ off Plug'n'Play. npm and bun need neither. Delete them only if you are
prepared to fix Metro resolution yourself.

## What's in here

```
app/                 Screens and routing (Expo Router — files become routes)
├── (tabs)/          Tab navigator: home, search, settings
├── _layout.tsx      Root layout, wraps the app in ThemeProvider
└── sheet.tsx        Example modal route
components/ui/       Your UI components — yours to edit
hooks/               use-color, use-color-scheme, use-keyboard-height, use-mode-toggle
stores/              Zustand stores — theme mode, search text, keyboard metrics
theme/               colors.ts, globals.ts
providers/           theme-provider.tsx (React Navigation theme)
```

## Adding components

```bash
npx bna-ui add avatar
npx bna-ui add badge card input
npx bna-ui add            # browse everything interactively
```

Dependencies come along automatically — adding `button` also brings the `text`,
`icon` and `spinner` it builds on, plus any npm packages it needs.

## Theming

Components read colours through `useColor`, so light and dark work everywhere
without per-component wiring:

```tsx
import { useColor } from '@/hooks/use-color';

const background = useColor('background');
const primary = useColor('primary');
```

Change the palette in `theme/colors.ts` and every component follows. Spacing,
radii and font sizes live in `theme/globals.ts`.

## Typography

The app is set in [Google Sans Flex](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Google+Sans+Flex),
loaded from `@expo-google-fonts/google-sans-flex` and registered in
`app/_layout.tsx`, which holds the splash screen until the faces are ready.

`theme/fonts.ts` deep-imports one weight at a time
(`@expo-google-fonts/google-sans-flex/400Regular`). Importing from the package
root instead would bundle all nine faces — it is a barrel that `require()`s
every TTF, and Metro does not tree-shake.

Keep styling text with `fontWeight`; `components/ui/text.tsx` maps it onto the
matching face, since React Native picks a font file by family name rather than
synthesising a weight:

```tsx
<Text style={{ fontWeight: '600' }}>Semibold</Text>   // GoogleSansFlex_600SemiBold
```

400 → Regular, 500 → Medium, 600 → SemiBold, 700+/`bold` → Bold. Pass an
explicit `fontFamily` (or one of the `FONTS` tokens in `theme/fonts.ts`) to
override. Raw `TextInput`s set `fontFamily: FONTS.regular` themselves — they
don't go through `Text`.

## These components are yours

BNA UI copies source into your project rather than installing a dependency.
Edit anything in `components/ui/` freely — nothing will overwrite it.

The trade-off: upstream fixes reach you only when you re-run
`npx bna-ui add <component>`, which asks before replacing files.
